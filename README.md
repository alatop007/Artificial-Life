## Agent-based Modelling of Collective and Coordinated Behaviour in NetLogo

In Model 1 turtles pile up “chips” (collecting attribute of ants), in Model 2 the turtles form grouping patterns based on attraction and repulsion (flocking attribute) and Model 3 integrates the grouping patterns that emerge in Model 2 with the collecting activities of Model 1.

Model 1: https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/Termites
This is an adaptation of the termite model in the netlogo. with additional feature of two adjustable circular objects that can be placed anywhere in the patch.

Model 2: Grouping patterns formed by eight predefined sets of six parameter values (vision-angle, three vision distances, search-angle and exploration-option). Also, the user have the opportunity to choose any of the eight sets when the model is running. The chosen set of parameter values are immediately activated and it
enables a direct inspection of the effect of parameter values on the type of grouping pattern.

Model 3: This is the integration of model 1 and model 2 allowing the turtle in model 1 accessing the flocking behaviours in model 2.
